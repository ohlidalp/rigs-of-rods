/// @file
/// @author Petr Ohlidal
/// @date 02/2017
/// @brief Motion platform integration
///
/// This implementation is based on motion simulator hardware & software
/// by Elsaco s.r.o, Czech Republic (http://motion-sim.cz/new)
///
///     THEORY
/// In both physics world and 3d engine, distance of 1.0 means "1 meter".
/// RoR's vehicles are entirely soft-body structures; there is no definite
/// 'front' or 'up', everything can and will deform. See also
/// http://docs.rigsofrods.org/vehicle-creation/vehicle-concepts/
/// To acquire orientation in space, each vehicle has 1 node marked "center"
/// and 2 other marked "left" and "back". This mechanism is known as "camera":
/// http://docs.rigsofrods.org/vehicle-creation/fileformat-truck/#cameras
///
///     RETRIEVING MOTION DATA
///  Method in place: use the "MotionFeeder" node-graph visual editor. User specifies node numbers to read from
/// and designs the process of calculating the outputs.
